# Movie Ticket Booking System

## About the Project
The Movie Ticket Booking System is a Java-based application designed to facilitate the booking of movie tickets. This system leverages various data structures to efficiently manage and process booking information. The primary goal is to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for users to book movie tickets.

## Features
- **User-friendly Console Interface:** Developed a console-based interface that allows users to easily book and cancel tickets.
- **Efficient Seat Allocation:** Ensures optimal seat allocation using arrays.
- **Priority Handling:** Handles priority reservations using priority queues.
- **Booking History Management:** Utilizes stacks to manage booking history, allowing users to undo their last booking action if needed.

## Data Structures Used
The project utilizes the following data structures:

1. **Arrays:** Arrays are used to store and manage the available seats in the theater. Each element in the array represents a seat, and its value indicates whether the seat is booked or available.

2. **Stack:** A stack is used to manage the user's history of booked tickets, enabling users to undo their last booking action if needed.

3. **Priority Queue:** A priority queue is employed to handle priority booking scenarios, such as VIP bookings. The queue ensures that higher-priority bookings are processed before regular bookings.
